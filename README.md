# OONI backend

Welcome to the OONI backend!

We follow the principles of a building a [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/),
which can be summarized as:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for
  new developers joining the project;
- Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum
  portability between execution environments;
- Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for
  servers and systems administration;
- Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous
  deployment for maximum agility;
- And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or
  development practices.
