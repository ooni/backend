## The above line replaces pip's default package index, and this line is
## removed from the .requirements.travis file, due to its incompatibility
## with the '--use-mirrors' option that TravisCI recommends. 
##
## The URLs in this file which have been commented out are due to a design
## problem in pip-1.3.0, where it ships with a default package index of
## 'https://pypi.python.org/simple', which though *it* was over SSL as
## promised, it still crawled the links on a module's PyPI page, which contains
## arbitrary links, such as project homepages, created by the PyPI maintainer
## of the module.  see
##
## https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-backend/pull/1#discussion_r4084881 for
## a detailed description of the problem, and why these links may still be
## useful until pip is updated again.
