  # Notes on smoke testing
  # ----------------------
  #
  # 1. The original smoke testing procedure was much more robust but travis
  #    started segfaulting and, upon investigating that, it occurred to me
  #    that having a simplified procedure like the one below would also work.
  #
  #    Specifically, if the process does not exit after `TERM`, my understanding
  #    is that the build will hang until travis kills it. This would fail the
  #    build and so we would know that the deamon doesn't handle `TERM`.
  #
  # 2. I need to copy the pidfile because it is deleted by the daemon when
  #    it exits, as such, using the original pidfile is racy.
  - sleep 30
  - cp oonib.pid oonib-persist.pid
  - kill -TERM `cat oonib-persist.pid`

  # 3. run regress tests
  - $(which coverage) run $(which trial) oonib
